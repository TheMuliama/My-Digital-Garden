 I am Muliama, at least this is the pseudo I choose to use on the internet. You may know me from school or from somewhere on the internet! I hope that this place could help you :) <br><br>
 If you are interested in my activities, you can see <a href="/notes">What am I up to</a>. <br><br>
 I write about what I found interesting and what I want to understand. I hope that this place will bring you no harm. Maybe will this site help you? <br><br>
 Thanks to the creators of Jekyll Garden to what made this site possible! If you too you want to create a Digital Garden, or a website from your markdown notes, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io">Github repo</a> this site was generated from. <br><br>
 Thanks to those who helped me to build this site by proofreading or teaching me things. <br><br>
 Also, thank <strong>YOU</strong> for reading my words! Hope you like them :) <br><br>
 Have a nice day!
