## Welcome to my garden.

I am Muliama, at least this is the pseudo I choose to use on the internet. You may know me from school or from somewhere on the internet! I hope that this place could help you :)

If you are interested in my activities, you can see [[What am I up to]]. 

I write about what I found interesting and what I want to understand. I hope that this place will bring you no harm. Maybe will this site help you?
