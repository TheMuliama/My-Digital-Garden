*This is a draft*
For this project, I tried the[ plan by The Digital Project Manager](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/managing-schedules/project-plan-guide/). 
## Important project info

1. **Why? The projectâ€™s strategic goals.**
The goal of this ~~project~~ quest is to create systems and habits that are going to help me achieve my life goals. To achieve this main goal, there is a few sub-quests to achieve.

Here there are:
	- To build and improve some health habits
	- To set up some very simple systems to manage my ressources

I've already tried to build systems like that but none of them worked more than two weeks. One of my hypothesis is that I've never taken into account the simple fact that I am humain. My actions aren't driven by logic, but by my emotions. 

I need to acknowledge my emotions and to work **along** with them, not against them. 

2. **What? The activities (or process), outputs, and project deliverables.**
There is few activities I need to do in order to complete this projects. 
	- To write into this garden
	- To plan my days and goals
	- To do work bout to get tasks done
	- To do a workout every day

The output will be the words I'll write in this digital garden. I'll tell my experiences, my thoughts, the results and what I think about it. The final deliverable will surely be a detailed document that describe my final system. 

3. **When? The deadlines and dependencies.**
I need to complete the steps of this project before the 15th December. I want to make sure that I build long lasting habits. 

## Define the Project Scope

Like I said before, **my goals are the following:** 
- To build and improve some health habits
- To set up some very simple systems to manage my ressources


**Here are the boundaries I set to myself:**
- For my health habits I won't create a detailed eating plan. 
- I will not create more than 3 workouts for my daily workouts.
- I won't concentrate on getting know by the internet
- I won't do anything in order to get money. I will not propose any services nor products
- I will not create any details artistic curriculum 

The goal of this project is to create the basis of some long-lasting habits. To make sure that the foundations of my systems focus heavily on my well-being.

## Outline the Project structure and Phases
In this section, I will develop the overall structure of the project. I will describe the different phases of the projects. 

- Phase one - The pillars of well-being
- Phase two - Create a planning system
- Phase three - Set up the garden
