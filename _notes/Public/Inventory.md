##### **Guidelines for acquiring new items**
Before you acquire any new item ask yourself the following questions:
- Do I really need it?
- What exact purpose will it serve?
- Is there an alternative I already own?
- How much better will it make whatever I intend to do with it in comparison to the alternative I already own?
- Can I make it myself?
- Is it reparable? Can I repair it myself when it breaks?
- Can I buy it pre-owned?
- Can I afford it? 
- Do it have a negative effect on my Well-Being?
